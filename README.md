# TTP-Assignment-5: TILE PAINTER

This project focused on incorporating GitHub Projects with Issues, Pull Requests, Assignness, Reviewers, and Labels as well as 
DOM manipulation skills using JavaScript.

In this project, users start off with a transparent 1 by 1 grid. A dropdown selector allows them to select a color, and
